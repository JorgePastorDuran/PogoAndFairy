# TFM_PogoFairy


Artificial intelligence created for the NPCs that attack the main player. The AI has been designed specifically for each enemy class, ranged and melee, using blueprints, c++, blackboard, AiController and behavior trees.

Predefined paths can be drawn for enemies, which will be interrupted upon detecting the player. They will attack the player from a radius away depending on the type of enemy.

An enemy generation tool has been created in which one type of enemy or another can randomly appear, as well as a number of enemies depending on the difficulty.
